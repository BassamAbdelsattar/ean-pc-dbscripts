here are the two Store procedures to use, to generate all the required XML import files and to upload the files.

Use following to run the sp's from the .bat file:
sqlcmd -E -S %MSSQL_ENGINE% -d %MSSQL_DB% -Q "EXEC spGenerateFormatFile @targetTable = '%%i'"
sqlcmd -E -S %MSSQL_ENGINE% -d %MSSQL_DB% -Q "EXEC spOneToRuleThemAll @fromFile = '%FILES_DIR%\%%i.txt', @formatFile='%BCPXML_DIR%\%%i.xml',@targetTable = '%%i'"

Only downside is that you need to enable xp_cmdshell which ppl might think is a security risk.
